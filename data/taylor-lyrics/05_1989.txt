Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York


When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York


Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything


Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy


New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend


So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no


Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream


So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya


So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time


You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style


So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl
He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"


'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
(A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style


Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh
(Out of style)


Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (And when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking


Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)


Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking


Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)


Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember


Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Are we?)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good


Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)


People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road


(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)


All you had to do was (Stay)

Here you are now, calling me up

The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?

All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay) (Ooh)
All you had to do was (Stay)

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

You could've been gettin' down
To this sick beat


My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, “Oh my God!” But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?

It's 2AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would


It's 2AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would


I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I


You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish I, wish I)


2AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would


(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I wish you would

’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me


Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I


’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't


Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I


’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!


’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!



He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down


He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is


Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha


I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now


He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is


Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha


You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around

Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh


Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want


And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say


I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl


Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why


And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say


I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)


That's how it works
That's how you got the girl

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this


This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh


Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone


Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time


This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh


(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)


Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need


This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh


(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I (I, I, I, I)


You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out


'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places


Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time


Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places


They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love


Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places


They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you (I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me (I know places)
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore


Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm


Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)


There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing


Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh


Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it


The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)


The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean


(Oh, oh)
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'm finally clean
